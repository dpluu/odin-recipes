        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <p>Now that we have our ingredients listed out for you, we can now put them all together to create our wonderful <em><strong>Complacency</strong></em>! Feel free to experiment with these listed steps in creative ways, though I doubt you will..</p>

        <ol>
            <li><em><strong>Do not try to look into the future</strong></em></li>
                <p>Blending together each day is a great way to remain complacent. Starting each day as a blank canvas is overwhelming for <em>Complacency</em>. Insteadm you can ruminate on your past accomplishments with the sense of 'been there don that'. If you already did it, why do it again but better? Such an idea is a waste of time for <em>Complacency</em>.

            <li><em><strong>Surround yourself with unmotivated people</strong></em></li>
                <p>constantly being around unmotivated people will do wonders for <em>Complacency</em>. This type of acquitance will never push you forward or give honest feedback. Instead of encouraging you to build and to keep improving, they will instead advocate for leisure activities. Why work when you can simply hang out?</p>

            <li><em><strong>Focus on the outcome instead of the process</strong></em></li>
                <p>The outcome is the only important part and the process is boring and tedious. Everyone knows this, so why bother honing in on your skills? Discipline and substaining the act of process is tiring. Instead, you should rush to the finish line so you can get back to the things you actually enjoy, whatever that may be.</p>

            <li><em><strong>Avoid learning and adapting</strong></em></li>
                <p>This is simply a waste of time and energy for <em>Complacency</em>. New experiences and environments induce anxiety. Remaining within the borders of your already established normalcy of routine and daily life is comforting. Why adapt when you can simply <em>remain</em>?</p>

            <li><em><strong>Stay up late, sleep in late</strong></em></li>
                <p>The underlying message to this crucial step is to get as much sleep as you possibly can get. The body needs sleep to heal and recharge. Staying up late gives you the alone time that you crave, while sleeping late grants you the opportunity to get the precious resource.</p>
        </ol>

            <p>If you follow these steps, you will surely achieve <em>Complacency</em>. The best part of these listed steps is that do not need to even try! You can simply live the best life of hedonism with the gratifying sense of past accomplishments.</p>
