        <h2>Steps</h2>

            <ol>
                <li><em><strong>Get Little To No Sleep</strong></em></li>
                <p>This is crucial. You will feel lifeless at all times. Your cognitive abilities will be always impaired and your risk for illness will be impressively increased.</p>

                <li><em><strong>Abuse Substances</strong></em></li>
                <p>Alcohol, drugs, cigarettes. Pick your poison!  The more the merrier.

                <li><em><strong>Stay Hung Up On The Past</strong></em></li>
                <p>It's terribly easy to obsess over past regrets and you may be surprised how much time and mental bandwidth can be consumed by doing so. This step is crucial as it will also alter your hormonal balance and motivation.

                <li><em><strong>Undervalue Everything</strong></em></li>
                <p>See the bad, ignore the good - make sure you appoint the lowest amount of value possible in every aspect of your life.</p>

                <li><em><strong>Inattentive And Uninterested </strong></em></li>
                <p>Ignore everything around you. It's not very interesting anyway, right? Being generally uninterested pairs well with being inattentive. This will make sure that any person who comes up to you to try to strike conversation will never try again.</p>

                <li><em><strong>Everything Else You Can Imagine</strong></em></li>
                <p>I believe in you: there's little doubt that you can come up with some great steps in your own way. It's a strange thing that it's sometimes easier to think of all the ways to live a horrible life than to live a Good life (with a capital 'G'). Trust your intuition. Or don't. Whatever is worse for you.</p>
