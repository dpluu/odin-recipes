# odin-recipes
This project is an example of a functioning website created with HTML.

Along with a Home page, there will be three seperate Recipe pages containing a list of ingredients, accompanied by an image.

All files for this website will be found in the 'odin-recipes' repo.

All source material will be found at the bottom of the page in which the informaiton was used for.
